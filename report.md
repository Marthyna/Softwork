## Softwork: Platform for Internship Opportunities

### Abstract
To obtain the technical training certificate at IFSul, the student is required, among other qualifications, to fulfill 300 hours of internship activities related to the course. Such a requirement often raises concern among students, due to the fact that finding an internship vacancy, whether in research projects or companies, is a task with obstacles such as demand being greater than supply, little disclosure of available places, etc. Thinking about this, the group developped an app that assists the student in the search for their internship, informing them of open vacancies nearby, and notifies the company when there is a candidate for the vacancy, facilitating the communication between them. To this end, the software must have an initial login screen or, if the user does not have an account, a registration screen, where basic information is required (for both company and student registration). In the later, it is still required that the student informs in which course they are enrolled. There is also a specific screen for the student, where they can view the companies in the region with open vacancies according to their course, consult the requirements for hiring, send their resume to the company and follow their current applications. There is also a specific screen for the company, where it can control the receipt of resumes, its available vacancies and the classification of candidates according to the hiring stages (curriculum evaluation, interview and final hiring). The app must notify the student when the status of their application changes in some company. In addition, the system has a database with restrictions for each type of user, as well as a login and password verification system. To ensure user security, the passwords are encrypted using symmetrical encrypting techniques. The app has both desktop and mobile versions, with mostly visual differences between them, with adaptations between their functionalities for funcionality enhancing. The system takes place through the client-server relationship, where the latter is responsible for database management and mediation between students and companies.

### Specific objectives 
- Make an automatic curriculum generator for students, assisting in the standardization of their resumes, taking in consideration how the quality of this document weights during the evaluation of the student's application to the vacancy offered.
- Make the search for vacancies in a specific sector or determined company easier for students, also taking into account the location of the company in case of students from other cities.
- Reduce internship search time, giving the students more time to work on their final report.
- Provide better organization and control of internship vacancies to companies, allowing them to select candidates according to the criteria chosen (specific training, languages learned, desired shift, etc.).
